## Core Concepts

### Dream Cycle (Ḥall + Lamm + Ḥulm)
1. **Ḥall (حَلّ)**: Deconstruction of complex symbols into fundamental seeds
2. **Lamm (لَمّ)**: Recombination of seeds to form new symbols
3. **Ḥulm (حُلْم)**: Integration of new symbols into the cognitive space

### Inverted Gabriel's Horn Model
- Symbols closer to the center (smaller radius) have greater cognitive depth
- Surface area increases as we approach the center
- Allows infinite meaning interactions in finite space

### Galactic Organization
- High-resonance symbols become galactic nuclei
- Connected symbols form spiral arms
- Self-organization of knowledge emerges

### Polar Coordinate Cognitive Space
```
Cognitive Space S = {(r, θ, φ) | r ∈ [0, R_max], θ ∈ [0, 2π], φ ∈ [0, π]}
```
Where:
- `r` represents cognitive depth (proximity to knowledge center)
- `θ` represents conceptual angle (semantic orientation)
- `φ` represents cognitive elevation (abstraction level)

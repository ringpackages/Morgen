## Overview

This file defines the `MorgenSymbol` class, which represents a "living symbol" or a fractal unit of knowledge within the Morgen AI paradigm. Each symbol is a dynamic entity with a unique identity, position in the cognitive space, and a set of properties that govern its behavior and interactions.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Knowledge Representation:** Encapsulates a unit of knowledge through its type, genome, and associated data.
- **Positional Awareness:** Maintains its position in the polar coordinate cognitive space (`nRadius`, `nAngle`), which defines its essentiality and context.
- **Dynamic Properties:** Manages dynamic attributes like `nResonance` and `nEnergyLevel` that change based on interactions.
- **Relational Connectivity:** Establishes and manages relationships (`aRelations`) with other symbols.
- **Evolutionary Capabilities:** Possesses methods for evolution, including:
    - **`deconstructToSeeds()`:** Breaks down the symbol into fundamental "seed" components (part of the á¸¤all phase).
    - **`mate()`:** Combines with another symbol to produce a new offspring symbol (part of the Lamm phase).
    - **`evolveGenome()`:** Introduces mutations to its core genome, allowing for adaptation.

## Core Attributes

- **`cId`:** A unique identifier.
- **`cType`:** The category of the symbol (e.g., `concept`, `experience`, `pattern`).
- **`aGenome`:** A list of values that acts as the symbol's unique signature or DNA.
- **`nRadius`:** The symbol's distance from the center of the cognitive space, indicating its depth or importance.
- **`nAngle`:** The symbol's angular position, representing its perspective or context.

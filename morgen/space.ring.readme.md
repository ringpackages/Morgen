## Overview

This file defines the `MorgenSpace` class, which is the core environment for the Morgen AI paradigm. It represents the cognitive space where `MorgenSymbol` objects exist, interact, and evolve. The space is modeled using polar coordinates and incorporates several advanced concepts from the Morgen philosophy.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Symbol and Relation Management:** Stores and manages all symbols and the relationships between them.
- **Cognitive Processing (Dream Cycles):** Implements the central `dreamCycle` functions (`dreamCycle`, `enhancedDreamCycle`, `advancedDreamCycle`) that drive the evolution of knowledge through decomposition (Ḥall), recombination (Lamm), and integration (Ḥulm).
- **Geometric Structuring:** Creates complex geometric structures like triangles, galactic clusters, and higher-order complexes to represent interconnected knowledge.
- **Wave Dynamics:** Simulates the propagation of waves (e.g., `insight_wave`, `question_wave`) that influence symbols throughout the space.
- **Meaning Condensation:** Implements advanced logic to find and condense related groups of symbols into new, more profound symbols (inspired by Ramanujan's work).
- **Cognitive Depth Model:** Uses the inverted Gabriel's Horn model (`adjustRadiusWithHorn`) to give symbols near the center of the space a greater potential for meaningful connections.

## Core Functions

- **`init()`:** Initializes the cognitive space.
- **`addSymbol()`:** Adds a new symbol to the space.
- **`dreamCycle()`:** The main engine for evolving the cognitive space. It simulates a cognitive process of reflection and insight generation.
- **`propagateWaves()`:** Spreads influence and change throughout the space.
- **`organizeGalacticClusters()`:** Self-organizes symbols into meaningful clusters based on resonance and proximity.

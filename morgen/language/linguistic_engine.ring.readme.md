## Overview

This file defines the `LinguisticEngine` class, which serves as the bridge between natural language (specifically Arabic) and the `MorgenSpace` cognitive model. It is responsible for both analyzing text to create symbols and generating text from existing symbols.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Text-to-Symbol Conversion:**
    - **`textToWordSymbols()`:** The primary function for parsing input text.
    - **`createArabicWordSymbol()`:** Converts an Arabic word into a `MorgenSymbol`. It does this by:
        1.  Identifying the constituent character symbols.
        2.  Combining the genomes of the characters to form the word's genome.
        3.  Calculating the word's position in the cognitive space based on the positions of its characters.
- **Arabic Root Extraction:**
    - **`createTriconsontalRoot()`:** Attempts to identify and create a `MorgenSymbol` for the triconsonantal (three-letter) root of a given word, a core concept in Arabic morphology.
- **Symbol-to-Text Generation:**
    - **`generateTextFromSymbol()`:** The main function for generating text from a symbol.
    - It employs various strategies depending on the symbol's type and complexity, including direct translation, fractal deconstruction (`fractalTextGeneration`), and generation from condensed symbols (`generateFromCondensedSymbol`).
- **Meaning Analysis:**
    - **`analyzeTextMeaning()`:** Takes a block of text and creates a single, higher-level `MorgenSymbol` that represents the overall meaning of the text.

## Core Process

1.  **Initialization:** The engine is initialized with a reference to a `MorgenSpace` and loads the fundamental Arabic character symbols.
2.  **Analysis (Text -> Symbols):** When given text, it breaks it down into words, creates a symbol for each word, and attempts to identify its root. These new symbols are then added to the cognitive space.
3.  **Generation (Symbols -> Text):** When given a symbol, it uses its properties, sub-symbols, and relationships to generate a corresponding string of text.
